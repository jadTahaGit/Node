Non-blocking || Asynchronous : (Node JS)
------------------------------
- Single Thread is used to handle multiple requests.
-  The Thread does not wait for the Database.
-  Event Queue will be created 
-  When the thread find an event in the queue -> it process it

Node good for:
---------------
- Serve more clients withou a lot of hardware.
- Nodejs  is scalable.
- Good Data Intensive and Real Time applications.
- Apps with a lot of disk or network access.
- Node is ideal for I/O intensive apps.
- Don't use Node for CPU-intensive apps.



blocking || Synchronous :
-------------------------
ASP.net || Rails

All threads are busy!
Large Number? Wait till 3 thrails are available.
Or add some Hardware.

- you could make ASP Asynchronous but we need to make some extra works.

- A signal that something had happend.
Example:

- The class raises an event.
- Our job is to response to that event. (by reading the event & giving back the right respond).
