What is NodeJS?
----------------

- JavaScript Runtime (Not a language or a framework).
- Built on the V8 JavaScript engine (same as Google Chrome).
- Written in C++.
- Esentially allows us to run JavaScript code on the server.

What should you know first:
---------------------------
- JavaScript Fundementals (objects, Arrays, Conditionals, etc).
- HTTP (status codes, headers, etc).
- Json
- Arrow Functions 
- Promises 
- MVC Pattern.


Why use Node?
--------------
- Fast, efficient and highly scalable.
- Eventdriven, non blocking I/O model.
- Popular in the industry
- Same language on the front and back end (JS)


- NOn-Blocking I/O:
----------------------
- Works on a single thread using non-blocking I\O calls.
- Supports tens of thousands concurrent connections
- Optimize throughput & scalablility in apps with many I/O operations
- All of this makes Node.js apps very Fast & efficient.



Node's Event Loop:
--------------------
- Single threaded.
- Supports concurrency via event & callbacks.
- EventEmitter class is used to bind events and listeners.



Best types of projects for node:
--------------------------------
Short Answer: anything that is not CPU intensive.

- REST API & Microservices.
- Real Time Services (Chat, Live Updates).
- CRUD Apps - Blogs, Shopping Carts, Social Networks.
- Tools & Utilities.


NPM: Node Package Manager:
--------------------------
- Install 3rd party Packages (frameworks, libraries, tools, etc).
- Packages get stored in the node_modules folder.
- All dependencies are listed in a "package.json" file.
- NPM scripts can be created to run certain tasks such as run a server.

Commands:
----------
npm init
npm install express           
npm install -g nodemon


Node Modules:
--------------
- Node Core Modules (path, fs, http, etc).
- 3rd party modules/packages installed via NPM.
- Custom modules (files)

const path = require ('path');
const myFile =  require ('./myFile')



From another computer:
----------------------
All the needed stuff woul be installed:
- npm install

- npm install uuid
- npm install -D nodemon   || npm install --save-dev nodemon


Usage:
-------
package.json:
--------------
After having the pacckage.json we could delete the node_modules 
and then just by typing npm install 
the needed libraries and packages will be installed

package-lock.json:
------------------
- saves the dependencies with the versions...
